There will be five phases to the launch of this MRT line:\n\nStage 1 Woodlands North(TE1) - Woodlands(TE3) - Opened on 31 January 2020. \nStage 2 Springleaf(TE4) - Caldecott(TE9) - Opened on 28 August 2021.\nStage 3 Mount Pleasant(TE10) - Gardens by the Bay(TE22) - Opened on 13 November 2022\nStage 4 Founders' Memorial(TE22A) - Bayshore(TE29) - Projected to open on 2024\nStage 5 Bedok South(TE30) - Sungei Bedok(TE31) - Projected to open on 2025\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Thomson-East Coast Line\n\n\nOur team is more interested in Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 4, which comprises 8 stations between Founders' Memorial and Bayshore that were scheduled for opening in the Year 2024. However, Founders' Memorial(TE22A) will open in tandem with the Founders' Memorial which is projected to open in 2027 so we decided to exclude it as a station in our project.\nWe want to understand whether the new Thomson-East Coast Line is still aligned with our original goal of better connecting the city centre and residential districts by comparing it to older MRT lines. For this we will be comparing the Thomson-East Coast Line with the North-South Line specifically from Yio Chu Kang(NE15) to Toa Payoh(NE19) which is the oldest station in Singapore that opened on 7 November 1987. Ultimately, we would like to use the derived insights gained from the analysis to provide justification on whether the Thomson-East Coast Line's goal is still aligned with the old MRT stations and if not what would be one of the main reasons for it.\n\n\n\nObjective\nThe following pointers summarise our project objectives.\n\nCreate of digitised web maps via QGIS of catchment areas based on walking distance of 5,10 and 15 minutes of each stations of the Thomson-East Coast Line and North-South Line\nAnalysis of Residential area at each MRT stations\nAnalysis of Accessibility of Thomson-East Coast Line to East Coast Park\nProvide insights and justification for Thomson-East Coast Line objective \nGain learning experience and project exposure\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\nData Source"
