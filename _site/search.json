    "text": "Overview\n<Whatâ€™s Instore For Thomson-East Coast Line in 2024>\nThis research project examines the new Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line, Thomson-East Coast Line. Our team is interested in Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 4, especially the seven stations between Tanjong Rhu and Bayshore that are scheduled for opening in the Year 2024. We want to understand whether the new Thomson-East Coast Line is still aligned with our original goal of better connecting the city centre and residential districts by comparing it to the older MRT line, the North-South Line specifically from Yio Chu Kang (NE15) to Toa Payoh (NE19).\nOur team aims to provide catchment areas based on walking distance of 5, 10, and 15 minutes of each station of the Thomson-East Coast Line and North-South Line and a choropleth map of accessibility to Thomson-East Coast Line stations. We will analyse residential areas at each MRT station and the accessibility of the Thomson-East Coast Line to East Coast Park, and finally, provide insights and justification for the Thomson-East Coast Line objective.\nIn this project, we applied QQIS methods such as the QNEATS3 tool, the shortest path tool and the analytical hexagon tool. From the analysis, we believe that the Thomson-East Coast Line is indeed aligned with the original goal of better connecting the city centre and residential districts as well as the East Coast Park.\nPlease check our full report for further analysis!"

    "text": "Motivation\nIt will open in stages from Year 2020 to 2025. There will be five phases to the launch of this MRT line:\n\nStage 1 Woodlands North(TE1) - Woodlands(TE3) - Opened on 31 January 2020.Â \nStage 2 Springleaf(TE4) - Caldecott(TE9) - Opened on 28 August 2021.\nStage 3 Mount Pleasant(TE10) - Gardens by the Bay(TE22) - Opened on 13 November 2022\nStage 4 Foundersâ€™ Memorial(TE22A) - Bayshore(TE29) - Projected to open on 2024\nStage 5 Bedok South(TE30) - Sungei Bedok(TE31) - Projected to open on 2025\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Thomson-East Coast Line\n\n\nOur team is more interested in Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 4, which comprises 8 stations between Foundersâ€™ Memorial and Bayshore that were scheduled for opening in the Year 2024. However, Foundersâ€™ Memorial(TE22A) will open in tandem with the Foundersâ€™ Memorial which is projected to open in 2027 so we decided to exclude it as a station in our project.\nWe want to understand whether the new Thomson-East Coast Line is still aligned with our original goal of better connecting the city centre and residential districts by comparing it to older MRT lines. For this we will be comparing the Thomson-East Coast Line with the North-South Line specifically from Yio Chu Kang(NE15) to Toa Payoh(NE19) which is the oldest station in Singapore that opened on 7 November 1987. Ultimately, we would like to use the derived insights gained from the analysis to provide justification on whether the Thomson-East Coast Lineâ€™s goal is still aligned with the old MRT stations and if not what would be one of the main reasons for it.\n\n\n\nObjective\nThe following pointers summarise our project objectives.\n\nCreate of digitised web maps via QGIS of catchment areas based on walking distance of 5,10 and 15 minutes of each stations of the Thomson-East Coast Line and North-South Line\nAnalysis of Residential area at each MRT stations\nAnalysis of Accessibility of Thomson-East Coast Line to East Coast Park\nProvide insights and justification for Thomson-East Coast Line objectiveÂ \nGain learning experience and project exposure\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Project Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source\n\nTable 1: Table of Provided Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Name\nData Format\nGeographic Representation\nSource\n\n\n\n\nThomson-East Coast Line Stage 4\n\n\n\n\n\ngis_osm_roads_a_free_1\nShapefile\nLine (MultiLineString)\ngeofabrik.de\n\n\ngis_osm_landuse_a_free_1\nShapefile\nPolygon (MultiPolygon)\ngeofabrik.de\n\n\nMP19_PLNG_AREA_NO_SEA_PL\nShapefile\nPolygon (MultiPolygon)\ndata.gov.sg\n\n\nTE_data\nCSV\npoint\nSelf Created from Google MapÂ \n\n\nNorth-South Line\n\n\n\n\n\ngis_osm_roads_a_free_1\nShapefile\nLine (MultiLineString)\ngeofabrik.de\n\n\ngis_osm_landuse_a_free_1\nShapefile\nPolygon (MultiPolygon)\ngeofabrik.de\n\n\nMP98_PLNG_AREA_NO_SEA_PL\nShapefile\nPolygon (MultiPolygon)\ndata.gov.sg\n\n\nNS_data\nCSV\npoint\nSelf Created from Google MapÂ \n\n\nEast Coast Park\n\n\n\n\n\ngis_osm_roads_a_free_1\nShapefile\nLine (MultiLineString)\ngeofabrik.de\n\n\ngis_osm_landuse_a_free_1\nShapefile\nPolygon (MultiPolygon)\ngeofabrik.de\n\n\nTE_data\nCSV\npoint\nSelf Created from Google MapÂ \n\n\nURA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL\nLIBKML\nPolygon (PolygonZ)\ndata.gov.sg"
